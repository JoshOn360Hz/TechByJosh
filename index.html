        <p>"Josh has helped me out three times now – all different problems, all happily, quickly, efficiently (and cheaply!) resolved with added value (there is nothing Josh doesn't know about tech). He's sorted out maximising wifi in the house, advised me on setting up a projector that I'd bought the wrong lead for (doh) and urgently rescued my website which had become corrupted and fell over (just as Corona Lockdown hit). Josh just gets to the solution – he usually knows what it is without much diagnosing and quickly sorts it out. I've had to force money on him in the past, so value is assured. Highly recommended for a multitude of issues and happy to provide a direct reference if useful."</p>
